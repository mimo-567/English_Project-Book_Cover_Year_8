## Appendix A (What is Whisk)

#### Whisk is a preview tool used in the US for a new AI image mode called Imagen 3. To access it I used a VPN

## Appendix B (Where did I get the AI Disclaimer description)

#### I got the AI Disclaimer from the website of the AI policy of Princeton (https://libguides.princeton.edu/generativeAI/disclosure)

## Appendix C (Information about the files)

#### The files in the zip file are images with no linked prompts but were proposed by the AI. The images in the .pptx file are images which do have prompts linked and are actually the proper submission
